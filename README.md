# Description
## This file contains the code for calculating the sample size (number of clusters) for the paper titled “Addressing Cluster-Level Treatment Effect Heterogeneity in Sample Size Determination for Hierarchical 2 × 2 Factorial Designs.”
## The SSCode.R file provides two approaches: one approximated by series expansions and the other using naive approximations.
