# Description
## This file contains the code for calculating the sample size (number of clusters) for the paper titled “Addressing Cluster-Level Treatment Effect Heterogeneity in Sample Size Determination for Hierarchical 2 × 2 Factorial Designs.” The SSCode.R file provides two functions for implementing sample size calculations: one using series expansions for approximation and the other using simple approximations. The SimulationCode.R file contains the simulation code for the random slope model.
